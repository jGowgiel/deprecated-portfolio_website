A multi-page Bootstrap enabled React App WITHOUT Redux

Scripts:

    ./scripts/new_component.sh

        Creates a new component with the given name in the "components" directory by
        copying the "template.js" file therein

        Requires some manual work, i.e. changing names, but the debug console will
        catch all of these
