A multi-page Bootstrap enabled React App

This repository contains the source code for my portfolio/project personal site, hosted at [jarodgowgiel.com](www.jarodgowgiel.com)

Scripts:

    ./scripts/new_component.sh

        Creates a new component with the given name in the "components" directory by
        copying the "template.js" file therein

        Requires some manual work, i.e. changing names, but the debug console will
        catch all of these
