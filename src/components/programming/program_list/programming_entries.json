It is designed to use two different data structures to store the image and perform the translations; either a blocked representation where each A x B section of the image is translated, or a representation where the image is represented by rows of pixels. This size of the section is determined by the program at runtime, and is optimized so that every block contains as close to 64KB of data as possible. The data structure to be used can be selected when the program is invoked.",

    "description": "As the final group project for COMP 20, a web programming course, my group designed and created a pizza sharing site. The app uses your current location, and seeks any nearby active orders on the site. Local pizza shops are retrieved using the Google Places API, and displayed on the map. After creating an order, you can sign up to be notified by text when other people connect to it. Once a full pizza has been 'crowd-sourced,' all parties are alerted so that they can continue the transaction. While still in beta, the site itself is functional.",
